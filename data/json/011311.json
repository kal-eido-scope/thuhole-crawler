Girth is the circumference of the penis at its widest section.\n……\nFor example, an erect penis of 6.3 inches is in the 95th percentile. That means that out of 100 men, only five would have a penis longer than 6.3 inches.\nLikewise, an erect penis of 3.94 inches is in the 5th percentile, meaning that only five men out of 100 would have a penis shorter than 3.94 inches.\n1英寸=2.54 cm","timestamp":1593505718,"type":"text","updated_at":1606782587,"url":"","vote":{}}}
